A `Reference` is a canonical assembled contig, intended to act as a
reference coordinate space for other genomic annotations. A single
`Reference` might represent the human chromosome 1, for instance.

`Reference`s are designed to be immutable. When extending a `ReferenceSet` with
new `Reference`s, the existing `References` should not be changed. Newly added
`Reference` sequences may be children of existing `Reference` sequences, but
existing `Reference` sequences should not be made to be children of newly added
`Reference` sequences.
